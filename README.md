# WikiFact
`WikiFact` is a dataset for training relationship classifiers and fact extraction models,
and accompanies the paper `Assessing The Factual Accuracy of Generated Text` [1]. 

## Data format
The data is available in three settings, each as a Tensorflow.Record collection of
Tensorflow Examples. The settings are - relationship classification, fact extraction from
sentences, and fact extraction from paragraphs. The inputs and outputs in each example
is a string, and we also provide sub-word or class (for relationships) vocabularies to
match the inputs used in our paper.

### Relationship classifier
Each example consists of a sentence with the subject and object marked with a prefix
(`SUBJ` or `OBJ`), and the target relationship. We also include the string representations
of the subject and object.  
Eg:
```
{
  inputs: "SUBJ{XYZ} was born in OBJ{ABC}",
  targets: "P19"  # Place of birth,
  subject: "XYZ",
  object: "ABC"
}
```

### Fact extraction
This format can be used to train sequence-to-sequence models. Each example consists of
an input sentence or paragraph that might contain facts about the subject, with multiple objects.
The outputs are a list of relation tuples of the subject (where each tuple is of the format 
`subject <t> relationship <t> object`), each separated by `<f>`. The inputs are prefixed with
the subject to guide the model.

Eg:
```
{
  inputs: "XYZ <eot> XYZ was born in ABC. They now live in DEF.",
  targets: "XYZ <t> born in <t> ABC <f> XYZ <t> lives in <t> DEF"
}
```
